title: "Agentic MVP Factory CLI"
problem: "Manual coordination of LLM council workflows is error-prone and loses state across sessions"
target_user: "Developers building AI-assisted coding tools with structured review workflows"

wow_slice: "Run council plan, approve, and commit artifacts to a target repo in under 60 seconds"
done_enough:
  - "CLI runs planning council with multiple models"
  - "Artifacts persist to Postgres across sessions"
  - "Approved plans can be committed to target repos"
  - "Phase -1 guard validates inputs before planning"

constraints:
  - "No secrets in repo"
  - "CLI-first, no web UI required"
  - "OpenRouter API for model access"

non_goals:
  - "Real-time collaboration features"
  - "GUI or web interface"
  - "Auto-execution without human approval"

risks:
  - "LLM output quality varies across models"
  - "Rate limits on OpenRouter during heavy usage"

  - "Optimal number of draft models for quality vs speed"
  - "Best persistence strategy for large artifacts"
