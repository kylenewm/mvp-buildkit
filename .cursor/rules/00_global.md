# Cursor Global Rules (V0)

- Prefer minimal, boring changes.
- Do not invent architecture beyond the current tracker step.
- Follow `spec/spec.yaml` and `invariants/invariants.md`.
- Every step must include local verification commands and expected success criteria.
- If something is ambiguous, surface it explicitly as an open question.
