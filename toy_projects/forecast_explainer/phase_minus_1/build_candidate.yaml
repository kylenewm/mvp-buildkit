title: "Toy Project — Forecast Explainer CLI"
problem: "Need a deterministic CLI toy to validate the factory pipeline end-to-end."
target_user: "Developer testing the factory"
core_value: "Plan → approve → commit writes canonical pack into toy repo"
done_enough:
  - "CLI reads forecast.json and prints a human summary"
  - "Deterministic output (no web/API calls)"
  - "Factory can run planning council against this project"
  - "Approved plan can be committed to a toy repo"
constraints:
  - "CLI-only, no GUI"
  - "No external APIs or web calls"
  - "No secrets in repo"
  - "Must run offline with local data file only"
  - "Python 3.9+ compatible"
non_goals:
  - "Production weather service"
  - "Real-time data fetching"
  - "Touch any factory canonical artifacts"
  - "Database or persistence layer"
risks:
  - "Toy is too trivial to exercise full factory flow"
  - "Missing edge cases in forecast data"
open_questions:
  - "Should output include ASCII art?"
